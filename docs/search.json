    "text": "6.1 Summary\nConclusion\n\nThe business task was performed and analyzed based on the problem that the main coach wanted to understand. The relation between minutes left, seconds left, distance shot and Efficiency Rate was successful measured and analyzed.\nThe main hypothesis was confirmed, there is a relationship between minutes left, seconds left, distance shot and the efficiency rate. Although all variables are related to the Efficiency Rate, the distance shot has a higher relationship with the efficiency rate than the other two time conditionals.\nUnderstanding the constraints of the game is a powerful decision-making strategy. Shots effectuated from a smaller distance to the hoop tend to be more effective, this applies to all years. If the coach wants to control more the unexpected conditionals during the game, shorter distance shots with fewer seconds left in the countdown clock is a good strategy. The relationship between minutes remaining is more stable throughout the game, that’s why no matter in which quarter of the game, the strategy of shooting close to the rim and close to zero in the countdown clock is a way to clear out unexpected conditionals.\nThis information can be valuable for all NBA basketball teams and coaches as it can lead to further research. In this particular case study the time/location variables of the shot were analyzed and related to the efficiency rate only.\n\nLong-distance shots trend in NBA: What’s all the controversy about?\nDespite the rise in three-point attempts, efficiency near the basket remained crucial. This highlights modern NBA offensive strategies, where teams aim to maximize scoring efficiency by prioritizing both three-pointers and close-range finishes. Did the Denver Nuggets win the 2023 finals thanks to three-pointers? The insights show that a balanced approach proves to be the winning formula.\nOpen inverstigation lines\n\nAlthough there are exeptions, humans perform better under pressure, and high performance athletes are used to work under pressure. The positioning of opposing players in a short distance to the hoop plus the countdown clock could play a role in the efficiency rate. In this study we focus on controllable time/location conditionals, we do not know what effect an opposing player might have had on these results.\nThe period of time taken was from 2015 to 2023 but the purpose of the coach was not to analyze the years separately. This can be performed as part of a new business task if the main focus changes to identify the differences between 2015 to 2023 seasons.\nIn the share phase, the visualizations were focused on distance shots as it’s an important variable that the main coach can control and train. Dashboards for minutes and seconds remaining can be included as part of a redefinition of the business task."
